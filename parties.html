    <h1>CossiePlay Parties</h1>
    <p>On the first Saturday of every month we hold a <span class="highlight">“CossiePlay Party”</span> at the town hall.
        <br>Entry is $15 for adults, $10 for ages 6-17 and kids under 6 are free.
        <br>Each entry includes one non-alcoholic drink and a glow stick.
        <br>Parties start at 6pm and run until 11pm.
        <br>There is always a live DJ at the party (who takes requests) and dancing is common (but not required).
        </p>

    <h2>Party guidelines</h2>
    <p>CossiePlay party-goers party at their own risk and are responsible for their own safety. Check with your doctor before you party hard.
        <br>Party fees must be paid at the door. Cash or EFTPOS accepted. Credit card payments attract a 2% surcharge.
        <br>Alcohol is served at the bar to over 18s only. No intoxicated persons will be served, but will be escorted to a taxi – paid by the party-goer.
